  <h1>Information About Typhoons</h1>
  <h2>What Are Typhoons?</h2>
  <p>Typhoons are one of the most powerful and destructive phenomenons that occur in the world. They usually develop overtime due to many various factors and conditions such as the oceanic currents, the winds, and environmental factors. </p>

  <h2>How Do Typhoons Develop?</h2>
  <p>Typhoons develop as tropical waves, and form in large bodies of water such as oceans. But for it to first start forming, the ocean or large bodies of water must first meet the condition of being warm enough to be at least 26.5°C. The formation will start and due to the heat, the water from the ocean will evaporate into the atmosphere, this will form humid air above the surface of the water. The humid air must be met by cold air, as the second condition is for cold air to be above the surface of the water. <br><br>The formation of clouds begins at this point. As this weather system moves across the tropics, an area of low-pressure forms underneath after warm ocean air rises towards the storm. This phenomenon causes the air to cool and rise, forming thunderstorms and clouds. Though there is a pressure that more or so over powers or counters it is known as a high-pressure area that forms due to the presence of cold, dense air, and it will influence the movement and strength of the storm.

  <br>
  <br><h2>Effects Of Typhoons</h2>
  <p> Tropical cyclone constitutes one of the most destructive natural disasters that affects many countries around the globe and exacts tremendous annual losses in lives and property. Its impact is greatest over the coastal areas, which bear the brunt of the strong surface winds, Storms, flooding, wild thunder and lightning, landslides, crop destruction, and other natural disasters resulting in damaged residences and structures, as well as insufficient food resources for everyone.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>The Philippines</h2>
    <p>The Philippines is the country that we reside in, we are   very vulnerable to typhoons due to their location in the western pacific basin, which is one of the most active typhoon basins in the world. Any part of the Philippines can be affected by typhoons, Visayas and Mindanao are just more vulnerable to the impacts of typhoons because of their geographical location. Both regions are in the southern part of Philippines meaning they are closer to the equator and therefore more prone to typhoons.

    <h2>Typhoon Effects By Odette</h2>
    <p> Typhoon Odette has caused severe damages when it hit the Philippines in December 2021. The typhoon brought strong winds, storm surges, and heavy rain that resulted in flooding, landslides, and power outages in many areas. According to the NDRRMC, there were 1147 injured or ill, 82 missing, and 410 dead. The typhoon damaged many homes, infrastructures, and agriculture in affected areas, resulting in an estimated cost of over ₱13.8 Billion.  <img style="  text-align: center;

      <br><br> Positive Impacts <br> There were positive impacts due to the typhoon in the region. These impacts are drought relief, thermal balance preservation, smoother flowing of rivers and increased fishing output. Which gladly retrieved the shortage of food resources after the destruction of farms.
